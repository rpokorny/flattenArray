This Repository contains example JavaScript code that flattens a deeply nested
array of numbers.  Thorough unit tests are included, as is a karma setup for
running them.

This repo was created as part of a job application.

Note to evaluators: Although a gist was requested, demonstrating functioning
unit tests required a more complex setup than could be communicated that way.
Therefore I created a whole repository instead.

# Usage
First run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Then, to exercise the code, run `npm test`.

This code was tested using npm 3.3.12 and node 5.3.0.
